# React Tic-tac-toe tutorial code

This is my attempt on recreating the tutorial game from [The ReactJS docs](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

## Advanced "tasks"

- [x] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [x] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- [x] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [x] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
